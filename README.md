# trainActivity

This activity was my first use of a database. It is connected to Google's Firebase. 

I used Bootstrap for some quick design, as I was focused mainly on the logic of storing information to the database. 
It can currently be updated by any user on any PC and information will be stored to the database. Due to having small amounts of 
JavaScript, I was able to condense the entire application into one HTML file.
